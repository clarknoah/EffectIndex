        <p> The official Effect Index community is hosted on Discord and may be joined <ext-link href="https://discord.gg/mNFMQpN"> here </ext-link>
        </p>

        <p> We believe that in pioneering formalised subjective effect documentation we may demystify
            the psychedelic experience, which has the potential to allow hallucinogen usage to become
            more culturally acceptable, better understood, and create a platform on top of which these
            substances may be more easily studied.
        </p>

        <p>
            Effect Index was initially founded as a side project on 30 June, 2017 by Josie Kins, the
            founder of <ext-link href="http://www.psychonautwiki.org"> PsychonautWiki </ext-link> and
            <ext-link href="http://disregardeverythingisay.com/"> DisregardEverythingISay</ext-link>.
            It serves as a platform for content
            that has been in constant development for the previous six years on these sites. However,
            the aforementioned content is now hosted on its own dedicated platform in the hope of further
            spreading the documentation and creating a universal terminology set which gives people the
            vernacular to fully describe experiences that were previously considered ineffable.
